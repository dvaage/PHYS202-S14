      "Einstein's theory of Brownian motion connects microscopic properties (e.g., radius, diffusivity) of the beads to macroscopic properties (e.g., temperature, viscosity) of the fluid in which the beads are immersed. This amazing theory enables us to estimate Avogadro's number with an ordinary microscope by observing the collective effect of millions of water molecules on the beads.\n",

      "The self-diffusion constant D characterizes the stochastic movement of a molecule (bead) through a homogeneous medium (the water molecules) as a result of random thermal energy. The Einstein-Smoluchowski equation states that the random displacement of a bead in one dimension has a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance \u03c32=2D\u0394t, where \u0394t is the time interval between position measurements. That is, a molecule's mean displacement is zero and its mean square displacement is proportional to the elapsed time between measurements, with the constant of proportionality 2D. We estimate \u03c32 by computing the variance of all observed bead displacements in the x and y directions. Let (\u0394x1, \u0394x2), ..., (\u0394xn, \u0394yn) be the n bead displacements, and let r1, ..., rn denote the radial displacements. Then\n",
