      "The first challenge is to identify the beads amidst the noisy data. Each image is 640-by-480 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a Color object which needs to be converted to a luminance value ranging from 0.0 (black) to 255.0 (white). Whiter pixels correspond to beads (foreground) and blacker pixels to water (background). Break the problem into three pieces:\n",

      "\n",
      "A polystyrene bead is typically represented by a disc-like shape of at least some minimum number, P, (typically 25) of connected foreground pixels. A blob or connected component is a maximal set of connected foreground pixels, regardless of its shape or size. Refer to any blob containing at least P pixels as a bead. The center-of-mass of a blob (or bead) is the average of the x- and y-coordinates of its constituent pixels.\n",
