      "The next step is to determine how far a bead moved from one time step t to the next t+\u0394t. For the test data, \u0394t = 0.5 seconds per frame. Assume the data is such that each bead moves a relatively small amount, and that two beads do not collide. (However, you must account for the possibility that the bead disappears from the frame, either by departing the microscope's field of view in the x- or y- direction, or moving out of the microscope's depth of focus in the z-direction.) Thus, for each bead at timet+\u0394t, calculate the closest bead at time t (in Euclidean distance) and identify these two as the same beads. However, if the distance is too large (greater than \u0394ppixels) assume that one of the beads has either just begun or ended its journey. Record the displacement that each bead travels in the \u0394t units of time.\n",

Note that it is not necessary to explicitly track a bead through a sequence of frames\u2014you only need to worry about identifying the same bead in two consecutive frames.\n"
